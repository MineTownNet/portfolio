      <p id="about-txt">Greetings, my name is Zak, and I'm a developer and Co-Owner of UDC-Studios. I live in the UK and started coding in 2017. I'm specialized in Blocks, Entities, and Animations. I have learned a lot over the past few years and have achieved results that brought me to the Marketplace. I would love to work for you, and I'm here if you need me.</p>
