    <div id="about">
      <p id="about-txt">Hello there! My name is Papier bndc, I’m the owner of UDC-Studios and also a Minecraft Bedrock Edition Developer. I’m living in Austria, which means that I speak The English and German language. I’ve been developing on addons since 2013 and earned a lot of knowledge on my jurney. I do all kinds of stuff in addons such as Entitys, Blocks, Items, or even json UIs. When I first got into addons, I aleady knew that this was where my future would be. I loved doing what I did, and I was good at it. In fact, I was that good, that I joined the marketplace program. My dedication in addons lies in making Entities and UIs, but I also enjoy doing all the other stuff. I hope that you got a good impression of me in these few words and Im happy, to work with you and for you!</p>
